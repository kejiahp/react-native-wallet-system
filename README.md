# Wallet management system mobile application

#### On heaven and earth, I alone am honored ðŸ¤ž

This a Mobile app serving the [Wallet management system API](https://github.com/kejiahp/wallet-management-system "wallet management system api")

I developed this project to serve as an system allowing registered users to store money in virtual wallets, withdraw money from the wallets and lock money for a duration and release it on a specified date back into their wallets.

This project was built using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev "React Native"), the open-source platform for building react native applications [Expo](https://expo.dev "Expo"), React context API for global state management, Axios as my Http Client, [Tanstack query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-query "Tanstack query") for Server state management, From state management [React hook forms](https://react-hook-form.com "React hook forms") [ZOD](https://zod.dev "ZOD") is my validtor of choice.
